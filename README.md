# Animated d3 data vis for fashion

# Bubble + Bar chart implementation in JS by Shelly Xu, referencing NYT visualizations and Jim Vallandingham's bubble_chart


## Description

This is a visualization of the top fashion brands with clothing lines, using animated bubble charts in JavaScript and D3.js. The study pulls information from in-person interviews/observations at NYC store locations, 100+ annual reports, 200+ news articles as well as company websites, BoF, LinkedIn and Glassdoor. Top brands are determined based on market share, revenue, and brand recognition. The study deliberately selects brands recognizable to the end user. Therefore, some brands are larger companies while others may be a part of a holding company. The study is not perfect. Private companies and brands under holding companies frequently mask their data. In those cases, you will find estimations based on news articles and public websites.
